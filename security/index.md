# Security overview.

## We protect your data.

All data is written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Files that our customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

## Your data is sent using HTTPS.

Whenever your data is in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS. Within our firewalled private networks, data may be transferred unencrypted.

Any files which you upload to us are stored and are encrypted at rest. Our application databases are generally not encrypted at rest—the information you add to the applications is active in our databases and subject to the same protection and monitoring as the rest of our systems..

## Full redundancy for all major systems.

Our servers operate at full redundancy. Our systems are engineered to stay up even if multiple servers fail.

## Regularly-updated infrastructure.

Our software infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches.

## We protect your billing information.

All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption—the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-Compliant network</a>.

## Constant monitoring

We have monitoring tools we’ve set up to alert us to any nefarious activity against our domains. We also audit internal data access. If a GroupNews LLC employee wrongly accesses customer data, they will face penalties ranging from termination to prosecution.

In the unfortunate event that someone malicious successfully mounts an attack on our system, we will immediately notify all affected customers.
