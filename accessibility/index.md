# Accessibility Statement

At GroupNews, we believe everyone should be able use our website and platform regardless of their abilities or the technology they have available. Our commitment to accessibility for all means that we strive to ensure all functionality on the GroupNews platform and website is available to and usable by all of our visitors and end users.

Our ongoing accessibility effort works towards conforming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, level AA criteria. These guidelines not only help make web content accessible to users with sensory, cognitive and mobility disabilities, but ultimately to all users, regardless of ability. Our efforts towards this goal are an integral part of our development process, and they work towards making groupnews.com as accessible as possible for everyone.

If you have comments or suggestions about how to improve GroupNews for users with disabilities, or if you found an accessibility issue, we’d be very happy to hear from you, so [please let us know](/support)!
