# GroupNews ownership & management policy

GroupNews groups are, by default, owned by the individual who created the group. Group ownership can be transferred to another group member, though. See our [Group ownership policy](/about/policies/ownership) for more details about how to do that.

The management of the group is done by Group administrators. The Group owner is also a Group administrator, and cannot have administrator rights removed. A Group can have any number of administrators, and that role can be assigned to any Group member.

## What can Group Administrators do?

Group administrators can:

- **Access all data in a group:** that means they have the ability to read all stories and newsletters within the GroupNews group.
- **Manage all aspects of the group’s plan:** including updating billing information, and adding more users.
- **Configure and manage all technical aspects of a group’s setup:** including setting up newsletters, changing the group domain.
- **Change Group Administrators:** We encourage customers to designate someone you trust to help co-manage your organization’s GroupNews group in case the primary Group Administrator is out of office. Group Administrators can add or remove other co-adminstrators directly in GroupNews. The one exception is: it is not possible within the app to revoke Group Administrator permissions from the primary Group owner who set up the group. In order to make changes to this primary Group Administrator, please [email us](/support) with the request.

## What can Group Administrators NOT do?

The only action which Group administrators cannot do is delete the Group. That ability lies solely with the the Group owner. If the Group owner is not available, please see our [Ownership policy](/about/policies/ownership) for how to proceed.

## Still have a question?
