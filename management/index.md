# GroupNews Ownership & Management Policy

GroupNews groups are owned by the organization detailed during signup, if this is a legal entity. If the organization is unincorporated, the group is owned by the individual who signed up for the group.

Regardless of ownership, the management of the group is done by Group Administrators. The person who originally signed up for the group is default designated as the primary Group Owner, but the role can be reassigned.

## What can Group Administrators do?

Group Administrators can:

- **Access all data in a group:** that means they have the ability to read all stories and newsletters within the GroupNews group.
- **Manage all aspects of the group’s subscription:** including updating billing information, and adding more users.
- **Configure and manage all technical aspects of a group’s setup:** including setting up newsletters, changing the group domain.
- **Change Group Administrators:** We encourage customers to designate someone you trust to help co-manage your organization’s GroupNews group in case the primary Group Administrator is out of office. Group Administrators can add or remove other co-adminstrators directly in GroupNews. The one exception is: it is not possible within the app to revoke Group Administrator permissions from the primary Group owner who set up the group. In order to make changes to this primary Group Administrator, please [email us](/support) with the request.

## Can GroupNews help us change the Group Administrator?

If the group is owned by a legal entity, we at GroupNews can reassign group management if provided with enough proof that the request is coming from a top-level organizational leader. To start a request to change the Group Administrator, an owner or chief executive of the organization must [email us](/support).

From there, we’ll ask for more verification of identity and relationship to the organization as well as ensure that there are no pending disputes of ownership. This process will likely take several days, as we need to make absolutely sure the request is legitimate.
If we’re unable to verify the legitimacy of the request, or if it’s being disputed by the current Group Administrator, we may require a properly served court order for GroupNews LLC to proceed.

## Still have a question?

Please [get in touch with us](/support) and we’ll be happy to answer!
